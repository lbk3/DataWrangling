### DataWrangling ###
A bunch of scripts that I have written in Python. For the most part they will be compiled in a Python shell (IDLE) rather than an development environment like PyCharm. Some scripts are for classes at university and some are things that I wanted to put together.

None of this code is related to any coursework and is all to further my learning and understanding of Python.

Libraries used:
  * IPython
  * NumPy
  * SciPy
  * TweePy
  * Pandas
  * BeautifulSoup
  * Matplotlib
